Field of complex systems, emergent phenomena. One such is multistability. Another is sync. Path towards the attractors is also important - transients. These are the objects of study in this thesis, which is subdivided into three main works. In the first, we study the robustness of solutions of phase oscillator networks. Malleability. 2 main factors: sts and multistabiltiy. Also study the emergence of multistability in coulped excitable neurons. We show a rich coexistence of oscilations arising from excitability, with only stable equilibrium. With two units XX, with more XX. We describe the different bifurcations giving rise to the attractors here and also provide a qualitative mechanism that describes all the attractors and also generalizes to more units. Then, switching the focus to transients, in particular long transients, metastability.
