Each realization of the system's parameters leads to a different transition to synchronization, i.e. a different curve in the figure. Realizations may differ from the others, for instance, in the parameter of a single unit. We see that the transitions to synchronization are different, as both the critical value of the coupling strength and the profile of the transitions differ, with the magnitude of malleability peaking during the transitions. Fixing the coupling strength, we can also look at the distribution of the degree of phase synchronization across samples (purple inset).\relax }}{22}{figure.caption.7}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.2}{\ignorespaces \textbf {Transition to phase synchronization and the effect of a single-unit change}. The figure shows the color-coded phases $\theta $ of all oscillators in the network and the degree of phase synchronization $r(t)$ (green line) across time for Watts-Strogatz networks. The coupling strength $\epsilon $ is fixed at $\epsilon = 4.51282$ and the natural frequencies ${\omega _i}$ in the first row are the same, generated by randomly drawing from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unitary standard deviation. Networks in the left column are two-nearest-neighbor lattices (rewiring probability $p = 0$); the short-range connections in these networks are then rewired in the following columns, with probability $p = 0.08733$ in the second column, $p = 0.19684$ in the third, and $p = 1.0$ in the fourth (leading to random networks). Increasing the proportion of long-range connections thus leads generally to more phase-synchronized networks. In the second and third rows, the natural frequency $\omega _i$ of a single unit $i$ (indicated by the gray arrows) is changed to a new value $\omega _i \to \omega _\mathrm {new} = 3.0$, with all other parameters being kept fixed. The units shown in the figure were those which led to the smallest (second row) or highest (third row) degree of phase synchronization $\ensuremath {R}$ out of all $N = 501$ units in the network for each value of $p$. Initial conditions were the same for all simulations, and were randomly drawn between $0$ and $2\pi $. \relax }}{25}{figure.caption.8}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.3}{\ignorespaces \textbf {Transitions to phase synchronization and dynamical malleability}. Networks under Watts-Strogatz (WS) and distance-dependent (DD) topologies reach phase synchronization through either an increase in coupling strength $\epsilon $ (given the topology has a sufficient amount of long-range connections) or by switching short-range connections to long-range. Fluctuations in the degree of phase synchronization $\ensuremath {R}$ between samples increase during the transitions, as can be seen by the differences in the same-colored curves and by $\Delta \mathrel {\mathop :}\mathrel {\mkern -1.2mu}=\ensuremath {R}_\mathrm {max} - \ensuremath {R}_\mathrm {min}$. Starting from a natural frequency sequence originally drawn from a Gaussian distribution (thicker lines), the other samples (thinner lines) can be generated by shuffling the natural frequencies or by switching the natural frequency of one unit to $\omega _\mathrm {new} = 3$. For intermediate networks (purple and green curves), the increase in the fluctuations (i.e. in dynamical malleability) extends for a wide range of parameters and becomes considerably large. Each panel contains $501 = N$ realizations, with rewiring probabilities fixed for the coupling transition, with values shown in the legend, and coupling strength fixed in the topology transition at $\epsilon = 4.51282$ for WS and $\epsilon = 6.46154$ for DD. The initial conditions are the same across all realizations, and are randomly distributed from $0$ to $2\pi $. The curves of $\Delta $ are qualitatively similar with other dispersion measures, such as standard deviation, a possible difference being that the curves may be slightly shifted, as the measures can peak at slightly different values of the control parameter. We remark that the parameter values used in the simulations were generated as described in Section \ref {sec:methodology} and correspond to the typical behaviors in the system.\relax }}{28}{figure.caption.9}%

The region of high phase synchronization is clearly seen for sufficiently high coupling strength $\epsilon $ and rewiring probability $p$. The colored lines correspond to the parameter values shown in Fig. \ref {fig:transition_sync}. The right panel displays $\Delta $, the difference between the most and least synchronized realizations for each pair $(p, \epsilon $), and we see that the fluctuations from sample to sample increase during the transitions to phase synchronization. The green and purple curves remain close to the region of transition for all $\epsilon \gtrapprox 1$, such that their fluctuations do not decrease with an increase in $\epsilon $. The figure uses Gouraud interpolation to ease visualization by smoothing the curves with a linear interpolation.\relax }}{29}{figure.caption.10}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.5}{\ignorespaces \textbf {Fluctuations in dynamically malleable systems are unpredictable}. Panel (a) shows the average phase synchronization $\ensuremath {R}$ for fixed coupling strength $\epsilon = 4.51282$ and rewiring probability $p = 0.08733$ for different $20$ shuffles of the natural frequencies $\{\omega _i\}$ and samples of networks generated by the Watts-Strogatz algorithm. For ease of visualization, the networks are ordered such that the highest network ids correspond to higher synchronization for $\mathrm {Shuffle\tmspace +\thickmuskip {.2777em}id} = 1$. For each shuffle, the network with the highest $\ensuremath {R}$ is marked with a red rectangle. We thus see that no network synchronizes more for all shuffles: $\ensuremath {R}$ is a function of both the specific frequency and topology samples. Panel (b) shows the changes $\delta R$ in the phase synchronization $R$ when the natural frequency of each unit is changed by an amount $\delta \omega $, such that $\omega _i \to \omega _i + \delta \omega $. Other parameters are fixed, in particular $p = 0.1145$ and $\epsilon = 4.51282$. There is a rough threshold (indicated by the black dashed lines), below which changing $\omega _i$ does not significantly alter $R$ ($\delta R < 0.1$ for the figure). Furthermore, changing the frequency does not have a monotonic impact on the change in $R$: small alterations in $\omega _i$, above the threshold, can have the same impact on $R$ as bigger alterations. \relax }}{30}{figure.caption.11}%

Phase synchronization and its dispersion for $501$ different shuffles (thinner lines) of the initial conditions, taken from the original initial conditions (thicker lines) used throughout the rest of this work.

The coupling strength $\epsilon $ (left panel) and rewiring probabilities $p$ (right panel) are the same ones used for WS networks in Fig. \ref {fig:transition_sync}. The multistable behavior is thus very similar to what we observed before by changing the frequencies (Fig. \ref {fig:transition_sync}(a) and (e)), and so shuffling the initial conditions for this network also leads to large fluctuations in the phase synchronization. \relax }}{33}{figure.caption.13}%
