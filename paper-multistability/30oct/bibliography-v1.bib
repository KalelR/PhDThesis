abstract = {{The dynamical systems found in nature are rarely isolated. Instead they interact and influence each other. The coupling functions that connect them contain detailed information about the functional mechanisms underlying the interactions and prescribe the physical rule specifying how an interaction occurs. A coherent and comprehensive review is presented encompassing the rapid progress made recently in the analysis, understanding, and applications of coupling functions. The basic concepts and characteristics of coupling functions are presented through demonstrative examples of different domains, revealing the mechanisms and emphasizing their multivariate nature. The theory of coupling functions is discussed through gradually increasing complexity from strong and weak interactions to globally coupled systems and networks. A variety of methods that have been developed for the detection and reconstruction of coupling functions from measured data is described. These methods are based on different statistical techniques for dynamical inference. Stemming from physics, such methods are being applied in diverse areas of science and technology, including chemistry, biology, physiology, neuroscience, social sciences, mechanics, and secure communications. This breadth of application illustrates the universality of coupling functions for studying the interaction mechanisms of coupled dynamical systems.}},

One of these, in which the oscillators are synchronized, persists and is stable for all coupling strengths.

The out-of-phase oscillation is unstable except on an open set in the frequency-coupling-strength plane which contains moderate values of both parameters. Furthermore, there are tori bifurcating from the out-of-phase solution, which means, according to the Arnol'd theory for Hopf bifurcations in maps, that there may be periodic solutions of arbitrarily large period and chaotic solutions as well. Numerous other bifurcations occur, and there are a number of higher codimension singularities.

We focus on local, nonlinear excitations and diverse neural responses in an excitable one- and two-dimensional configuration of diffusively coupled FitzHugh–Rinzel neurons. The study of the emerging spatiotemporal patterns is essential in understanding the working mechanism in different brain areas. We derive analytically the coefficients of the amplitude equations in the vicinity of Hopf bifurcations and characterize various patterns, including spirals exhibiting complex geometric substructures. Furthermore, we derive analytically the condition for the development of antispirals in the neighborhood of the bifurcation point. The emergence of broken target waves can be observed to form spiral-like profiles. The spatial dynamics of the excitable system exhibits two- and multi-arm spirals for small diffusive couplings. Our results reveal a multitude of neural excitabilities and possible conditions for the emergence of spiral-wave formation.

abstract = {{Partial phase synchronization, also reported as neuron cooperation, is a pivotal behavior of the brain and related to its main features, such as memory. The excess or even the lack of phase synchronization are associated with brain disorders like epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. These diseases may be related to malfunctioning of the synchronization process of the neurons, triggered by changes of the local dynamics of the neurons influenced by parameters such as the ion-channel conductance. In fact, it is common to change the local neuron dynamics, using drugs to block or activate specific channels, changing the conductance and bringing the synchronization process to some desired behavior. Here we show that there are two distinct mechanisms leading to network phase synchronized states. The first one is strongly affected by the individual neuron dynamics. In this case, the synchronous state of the network may occur for low values of the coupling, regardless of the network topology. The second synchronized state is induced by the network coupling, in this case the network coupling strength promotes synchronized global states, we say it is a network driver synchronization. We report here how individual characteristics of the local dynamics of the neurons, such as their linear stability, when coupled in a network may be a fundamental player in the phase synchronization process as a function of the coupling strength. Global and small-world topologies are considered for a Hindmarsh–Rose-neuron network. For both coupling schemes, the effects of the local dynamics are clear, inducing early or retarding the occurrence of partial phase synchronization of the network when the coupling strength is varied. In this scenario, we discuss the effect of the local dynamics of the neuron, showing it may be of fundamental importance to understand and control the process of the network phase synchronization. The study also brings useful information to the general understanding of network-phase-synchronization processes.}},

In this regard, the master stability function and time-averaged synchronization error are employed as the analytical and numerical approaches to examine complete synchronization. Apart from the complete synchrony, the constructed networks are explored to find other synchronization patterns and multistability. The results obtained from the master stability function analysis, which are further approved by the numerical outcomes, show that when coupled through the linear diffusive function, the interacting laser models achieve complete synchrony in a small value of the coupling parameter. However, in the nonlinear case, complete synchronization cannot be attained. Moreover, multistability can be observed in different network states, including cluster synchronization, chimera, and solitary states.}},

However, diffusive coupling is capable of suppressing intrinsic oscillations due to the manifestation of the phenomena of amplitude and oscillation deaths. Here we present a scheme to revoke these quenching states in diffusively coupled dynamical networks, and demonstrate the approach in experiments with an oscillatory chemical reaction. By introducing a simple feedback factor in the diffusive coupling, we show that the stable (in)homogeneous steady states can be effectively destabilized to restore dynamic behaviours of coupled systems. Even a feeble deviation from the normal diffusive coupling drastically shrinks the death regions in the parameter space. The generality of our method is corroborated in diverse non-linear systems of diffusively coupled paradigmatic models with various death scenarios. Our study provides a general framework to strengthen the robustness of dynamic activity in diffusively coupled dynamical networks. Oscillatory behaviour is essential for proper functioning of several processes, yet quenching phenomena can lead to steady states with suppressed oscillations.

Spatially neighboring plankton communities with different physical conditions can impact each other due to diffusive coupling. We show that local variations in the physical conditions can influence the global system in form of propagating pulses of high population densities.

Ocean plankton populations as excitable media. Bull. Math. Biol. 56, 981–998]. The extension is a seasonal forcing of the phytoplankton growth rate driven by an oscillating temperature via a Q10 law. We observe bistable long-term behaviour of the ecological system, i.e. a bloom and non-bloom mode, the importance of timing, and noise-induced switchings between the bloom and non-bloom mode. We link the model results to existing Helgoland Roads long-term data series by analysing the latter using the novel method of bloom-triggered averaging, a tool borrowed from signal analysis of neurophysiological recordings. We find that on an average blooms are correlated with rapid upward temperature fluctuations and speculate on their possible role as trigger mechanisms.}},

The avalanches coexist with the fully synchronous state where the units perform relaxation oscillations. We show that the mechanism behind the avalanches is based on an inhibitory effect of interactions, which may quench the spiking of units due to an interplay with the maximal canard. The avalanche activity bears certain heralds of criticality, including scale-invariant distributions of event sizes. Furthermore, the system shows increased sensitivity to perturbations, manifested as critical slowing down and reduced resilience.}},

Compared to large networks of oscillators, minimal networks are more susceptible to changes in coupling parameters, the number of oscillators, and network topologies. In this study, we systematically explore the influence of these parameters on the dynamics of a minimal network comprising Stuart-Landau oscillators coupled with a distance-dependent time delay. We examine three network topologies: ring, chain, and star. Specifically, for ring networks, we study the effects of increasing nonlocality from local to global coupling on the overall dynamics of the system. Our findings reveal the existence of various synchronized states, including splay and cluster states, a partially synchronized state such as chimeric quasiperiodicity, and an oscillation quenching state such as amplitude death in these networks. Moreover, through an analysis of long-lived transients, we discover novel amplitude-modulated states within ring networks. Interestingly, we observe that increasing nonlocality diminishes the influence of the number of oscillators on the overall behavior in these networks. Furthermore, we note that chain networks, unlike ring networks, do not exhibit perfect synchrony among the coupled oscillators. In contrast, star networks demonstrate greater stability and are unaffected by the number of oscillators within the network. The insights from this study deepen our understanding of the dynamics of minimal networks and have implications for various fields, ranging from biology to engineering.}},

In this paper, we show that networks of coupled phase oscillators with nonlinear interactions can acquire a very large and complicated sensitivity to changes made in either their units' parameters or in their connections. Even modifications made to a parameter of a single unit can radically alter the global dynamics of the network in an unpredictable manner. This occurs over a wide parameter region, around the network's transitions to phase synchronization. We argue that this is a widespread phenomenon that can be expected in real-world systems, extending even beyond networks of oscillators.}},

A powerful tool to understand such systems, as well as to better predict when they may “tip” from one stable state to the other, is global stability analysis. It involves identifying the initial conditions that converge to each attractor, known as the basins of attraction, measuring the relative volume of these basins in state space, and quantifying how these fractions change as a system parameter evolves. By improving existing approaches, we present a comprehensive framework that allows for global stability analysis of dynamical systems. Notably, our framework enables the analysis to be made efficiently and conveniently over a parameter range. As such, it becomes an essential tool for stability analysis of dynamical systems that goes beyond local stability analysis offered by alternative frameworks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of models, including climate, power grids, ecosystems, and more.

In this paper we study their dynamical behavior as we couple them in the same configurations as we have done for their counterpart biological neurons. The interconnections we use for these neural oscillators are both direct electrical connections and excitatory and inhibitory chemical connections: each realized by analog circuitry and suggested by biological examples. We provide here quantitative evidence that the ENs and the biological neurons behave similarly when coupled in the same manner. They each display well defined bifurcations in their mutual synchronization and regularization. We report briefly on an experiment on coupled biological neurons and four-dimensional ENs, which provides further ground for testing the validity of our numerical and electronic models of individual neural behavior.

This intriguing “weak-winner” synchronization phenomenon can be explained by the interplay between nonisochronicity and the natural frequency of the oscillator, as coupling strength is varied. Furthermore, we present sufficient conditions under which the weak-winner phase synchronization can occur for limit cycles as well as chaotic oscillators. Employing a model system from ecology as well as a paradigmatic model from physics, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is a generic feature for a large class of coupled oscillator systems. The realization of this peculiar, yet quite generic weak-winner dynamics can have far-reaching consequences in a wide range of scientific disciplines that deal with the phenomenon of phase synchronization, including synchronization of networks. Our results also highlight the role of nonisochronicity (shear) as a fundamental feature of an oscillator in shaping emergent dynamical patterns in complex networks.}},

These findings may be used to optimize stability and help devise new control schemes, thus offering an additional layer of protection and contributing to the development of smart grids that can recover from failures in real time. Power-grid networks must be synchronized in order to function. A condition for the stability of the synchronous state enables identification of network parameters that enhance spontaneous synchronization—heralding the possibility of smart grids that operate optimally in real-world systems.}},

In order to do this, suitable, easy to compute, statistics of trajectories with randomly generated initial conditions and parameters are clustered by an algorithm such as DBSCAN. Due to its modular and flexible nature, our method has a wide range of possible applications in many disciplines. While typical applications are oscillator networks, it is not limited only to ordinary differential equation systems, every complex system yielding trajectories, such as maps or agent-based models, can be analyzed, as we show by applying it the Dodds–Watts model, a generalized SIRS-model, modeling social and biological contagion. A second order Kuramoto model, used, e.g. to investigate power grid dynamics, and a Stuart–Landau oscillator network, each exhibiting a complex multistable regime, are shown as well.

A consequence of this is that a short depolarizing current pulse will change an initially silent model neuron into one that fires repetitively. Addition of a third equation limits this firing to either an isolated burst or a depolarizing afterpotential. When steady depolarizing current was applied to this model it resulted in periodic bursting. The equations, which were initially developed to explain isolated triggered bursts, therefore provide one of the simplest models of the more general phenomenon of oscillatory burst discharge.}},

abstract = {{The Julia programming language is gaining enormous popularity. Julia was designed to be easy and fast. Most importantly, Julia shatters deeply established notions widely held in the applied community: 1. High-level, dynamic code has to be slow by some sort of law of nature 2. It is sensible to prototype in one language and then recode in another language 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. Julia began with a deep understanding of the needs of the scientic programmer and the needs of the computer in mind. Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from computer science and computational science creating a new approach to scientic computing. This note introduces the programmer to the language and the underlying design theory. It invites the reader to rethink the fundamental foundations of numerical computing systems. In particular, there is the fascinating dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. We can pick just the right algorithm for the right circumstance and this can happen at runtime based on argument types (code selection via multiple dispatch). Abstraction recognizes what remains the same after dierences are stripped away and ignored as irrelevant. The recognition of abstraction allows for code reuse (generic programming). A simple idea that yields incredible power. The Julia design facilitates this interplay in many explicit and subtle ways for machine performance and, most importantly, human convenience.}},

abstract = {{Anomalous phase synchronization describes a synchronization phenomenon occurring even for the weakly coupled network and characterized by a non-monotonous dependence of the synchronization strength on the coupling strength. Its existence may support a theoretical framework to some neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's and some episodes of seizure behavior generated by epilepsy. Despite the success of controlling or suppressing the anomalous phase synchronization in neural networks applying external perturbations or inducing ambient changes, the origin of the anomalous phase synchronization as well as the mechanisms behind the suppression is not completely known. Here, we consider networks composed of N=2000 coupled neurons in a small-world topology for two well known neuron models, namely, the Hodgkin-Huxley-like and the Hindmarsh-Rose models, both displaying the anomalous phase synchronization regime. We show that the anomalous phase synchronization may be related to the individual behavior of the coupled neurons; particularly, we identify a strong correlation between the behavior of the inter-bursting-intervals of the neurons, what we call neuron variability, to the ability of the network to depict anomalous phase synchronization. We corroborate the ideas showing that external perturbations or ambient parameter changes that eliminate anomalous phase synchronization and at the same time promote small changes in the individual dynamics of the neurons, such that an increasing individual variability of neurons implies a decrease of anomalous phase synchronization. Finally, we demonstrate that this effect can be quantified using a well known recurrence quantifier, the "determinism." Moreover, the results obtained by the determinism are based on only the mean field potential of the network, turning these measures more suitable to be used in experimental situations.}},

We demonstrate that disturbances to the local dynamics of network units can produce different outcomes to synchronization depending on the current state of its trajectory. We address such state dependence by systematically perturbing the synchronized system at states equally distributed along its trajectory. We find the states at which the perturbation desynchronizes the network to be complicatedly mixed with the ones that restore synchronization. Additionally, we characterize perturbation sets obtained for consecutive states by defining a safety index between them. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed vulnerability is due to the existence of an unstable chaotic set in the system's state space.}},

abstract = {{We report on self-induced switchings between multiple distinct space-time patterns in the dynamics of a spatially extended excitable system. These switchings between low-amplitude oscillations, nonlinear waves, and extreme events strongly resemble a random process, although the system is deterministic. We show that a chaotic saddle-which contains all the patterns as well as channel-like structures that mediate the transitions between them-is the backbone of such a pattern-switching dynamics. Our analyses indicate that essential ingredients for the observed phenomena are that the system behaves like an inhomogeneous oscillatory medium that is capable of self-generating spatially localized excitations and that is dominated by short-range connections but also features long-range connections. With our findings, we present an alternative to the well-known ways to obtain self-induced pattern switching, namely, noise-induced attractor hopping, heteroclinic orbits, and adaptation to an external signal. This alternative way can be expected to improve our understanding of pattern switchings in spatially extended natural dynamical systems like the brain and the heart.}},

The basin stability is a global stability metric that builds on estimating the basin of attraction volumes by Monte Carlo sampling. The computation involves extensive numerical time integrations, attractor characterization, and clustering of trajectories. We introduce bSTAB, an open-source software project that aims at enabling researchers to efficiently compute the basin stability of their dynamical systems with minimal efforts and in a highly automated manner. The source code, available at https://github.com/TUHH-DYN/bSTAB/, is available for the programming language Matlab featuring parallelization for distributed computing, automated sensitivity and bifurcation analysis as well as plotting functionalities. We illustrate the versatility and robustness of bSTAB for four canonical dynamical systems from several fields of nonlinear dynamics featuring periodic and chaotic dynamics, complicated multi-stability, non-smooth dynamics, and fractal basins of attraction. The bSTAB projects aims at fostering interdisciplinary scientific collaborations in the field of nonlinear dynamics and is driven by the interaction and contribution of the community to the software package.}},
