abstract = {{The pervasiveness of multi-stability in nonlinear dynamical systems calls for novel concepts of stability and a consistent quantification of long-term behavior. The basin stability is a global stability metric that builds on estimating the basin of attraction volumes by Monte Carlo sampling. The computation involves extensive numerical time integrations, attractor characterization, and clustering of trajectories. We introduce bSTAB, an open-source software project that aims at enabling researchers to efficiently compute the basin stability of their dynamical systems with minimal efforts and in a highly automated manner. The source code, available at https://github.com/TUHH-DYN/bSTAB/, is available for the programming language Matlab featuring parallelization for distributed computing, automated sensitivity and bifurcation analysis as well as plotting functionalities. We illustrate the versatility and robustness of bSTAB for four canonical dynamical systems from several fields of nonlinear dynamics featuring periodic and chaotic dynamics, complicated multi-stability, non-smooth dynamics, and fractal basins of attraction. The bSTAB projects aims at fostering interdisciplinary scientific collaborations in the field of nonlinear dynamics and is driven by the interaction and contribution of the community to the software package.}},

In particular, we explore the phase space structure, calculate basins of attraction, analyze the region of existence of solitary states in the system’s parameter space, and investigate how the number of solitary nodes in the network depends on the coupling parameters. We report for the first time the occurrence of solitary state chimera in networks of coupled time-continuous neural systems. Our results disclose distinctive features characteristic of solitary states in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, such as the flat mean phase velocity profile. On the other hand, we show that the mechanism of solitary states’ formation in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model similar to chaotic maps and the Kuramoto model with inertia is related to the appearance of bistability in the system for certain values of coupling parameters. This indicates a general, probably a universal desynchronization scenario via solitary states in networks of very different nature.}},

Our analyses indicate that essential ingredients for the observed phenomena are that the system behaves like an inhomogeneous oscillatory medium that is capable of self-generating spatially localized excitations and that is dominated by short-range connections but also features long-range connections. With our findings, we present an alternative to the well-known ways to obtain self-induced pattern switching, namely, noise-induced attractor hopping, heteroclinic orbits, and adaptation to an external signal. This alternative way can be expected to improve our understanding of pattern switchings in spatially extended natural dynamical systems like the brain and the heart.}},

abstract = {{The stability of synchronised networked systems is a multi-faceted challenge for many natural and technological fields, from cardiac and neuronal tissue pacemakers to power grids. For these, the ongoing transition to distributed renewable energy sources leads to a proliferation of dynamical actors. The desynchronisation of a few or even one of those would likely result in a substantial blackout. Thus the dynamical stability of the synchronous state has become a leading topic in power grid research. Here we uncover that, when taking into account physical losses in the network, the back-reaction of the network induces new exotic solitary states in the individual actors and the stability characteristics of the synchronous state are dramatically altered. These effects will have to be explicitly taken into account in the design of future power grids. We expect the results presented here to transfer to other systems of coupled heterogeneous Newtonian oscillators. The design of future power grids with decentral control calls for a better understanding of the stability of synchronized networked systems. Here, Hellmann et al. show that the energy losses in coupled oscillators can significantly alter power grid dynamics by introducing solitary states in the network.}},

Its existence may support a theoretical framework to some neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's and some episodes of seizure behavior generated by epilepsy. Despite the success of controlling or suppressing the anomalous phase synchronization in neural networks applying external perturbations or inducing ambient changes, the origin of the anomalous phase synchronization as well as the mechanisms behind the suppression is not completely known. Here, we consider networks composed of N=2000 coupled neurons in a small-world topology for two well known neuron models, namely, the Hodgkin-Huxley-like and the Hindmarsh-Rose models, both displaying the anomalous phase synchronization regime. We show that the anomalous phase synchronization may be related to the individual behavior of the coupled neurons; particularly, we identify a strong correlation between the behavior of the inter-bursting-intervals of the neurons, what we call neuron variability, to the ability of the network to depict anomalous phase synchronization. We corroborate the ideas showing that external perturbations or ambient parameter changes that eliminate anomalous phase synchronization and at the same time promote small changes in the individual dynamics of the neurons, such that an increasing individual variability of neurons implies a decrease of anomalous phase synchronization. Finally, we demonstrate that this effect can be quantified using a well known recurrence quantifier, the "determinism." Moreover, the results obtained by the determinism are based on only the mean field potential of the network, turning these measures more suitable to be used in experimental situations.}},

Most importantly, Julia shatters deeply established notions widely held in the applied community: 1. High-level, dynamic code has to be slow by some sort of law of nature 2. It is sensible to prototype in one language and then recode in another language 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. Julia began with a deep understanding of the needs of the scientic programmer and the needs of the computer in mind. Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from computer science and computational science creating a new approach to scientic computing. This note introduces the programmer to the language and the underlying design theory. It invites the reader to rethink the fundamental foundations of numerical computing systems. In particular, there is the fascinating dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. We can pick just the right algorithm for the right circumstance and this can happen at runtime based on argument types (code selection via multiple dispatch). Abstraction recognizes what remains the same after dierences are stripped away and ignored as irrelevant. The recognition of abstraction allows for code reuse (generic programming). A simple idea that yields incredible power. The Julia design facilitates this interplay in many explicit and subtle ways for machine performance and, most importantly, human convenience.}},

In one region all phase paths approach a limit cycle and in the other all phase paths approach a stable equilibrium point. A consequence of this is that a short depolarizing current pulse will change an initially silent model neuron into one that fires repetitively. Addition of a third equation limits this firing to either an isolated burst or a depolarizing afterpotential. When steady depolarizing current was applied to this model it resulted in periodic bursting. The equations, which were initially developed to explain isolated triggered bursts, therefore provide one of the simplest models of the more general phenomenon of oscillatory burst discharge.}},

In order to do this, suitable, easy to compute, statistics of trajectories with randomly generated initial conditions and parameters are clustered by an algorithm such as DBSCAN. Due to its modular and flexible nature, our method has a wide range of possible applications in many disciplines. While typical applications are oscillator networks, it is not limited only to ordinary differential equation systems, every complex system yielding trajectories, such as maps or agent-based models, can be analyzed, as we show by applying it the Dodds–Watts model, a generalized SIRS-model, modeling social and biological contagion.

Employing a model system from ecology as well as a paradigmatic model from physics, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is a generic feature for a large class of coupled oscillator systems. The realization of this peculiar, yet quite generic weak-winner dynamics can have far-reaching consequences in a wide range of scientific disciplines that deal with the phenomenon of phase synchronization, including synchronization of networks. Our results also highlight the role of nonisochronicity (shear) as a fundamental feature of an oscillator in shaping emergent dynamical patterns in complex networks.}},

abstract = {{Barnacle muscle fibers subjected to constant current stimulation produce a variety of types of oscillatory behavior when the internal medium contains the Ca++ chelator EGTA. Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time during cellular activity), a system dominated by two noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and bistable behavior.}},

In this paper we study their dynamical behavior as we couple them in the same configurations as we have done for their counterpart biological neurons. The interconnections we use for these neural oscillators are both direct electrical connections and excitatory and inhibitory chemical connections: each realized by analog circuitry and suggested by biological examples. We provide here quantitative evidence that the ENs and the biological neurons behave similarly when coupled in the same manner. They each display well defined bifurcations in their mutual synchronization and regularization. We report briefly on an experiment on coupled biological neurons and four-dimensional ENs, which provides further ground for testing the validity of our numerical and electronic models of individual neural behavior.

It involves identifying the initial conditions that converge to each attractor, known as the basins of attraction, measuring the relative volume of these basins in state space, and quantifying how these fractions change as a system parameter evolves. By improving existing approaches, we present a comprehensive framework that allows for global stability analysis of dynamical systems. Notably, our framework enables the analysis to be made efficiently and conveniently over a parameter range. As such, it becomes an essential tool for stability analysis of dynamical systems that goes beyond local stability analysis offered by alternative frameworks.

In this paper, we show that networks of coupled phase oscillators with nonlinear interactions can acquire a very large and complicated sensitivity to changes made in either their units' parameters or in their connections. Even modifications made to a parameter of a single unit can radically alter the global dynamics of the network in an unpredictable manner. This occurs over a wide parameter region, around the network's transitions to phase synchronization. We argue that this is a widespread phenomenon that can be expected in real-world systems, extending even beyond networks of oscillators.}},

Compared to large networks of oscillators, minimal networks are more susceptible to changes in coupling parameters, the number of oscillators, and network topologies. In this study, we systematically explore the influence of these parameters on the dynamics of a minimal network comprising Stuart-Landau oscillators coupled with a distance-dependent time delay. We examine three network topologies: ring, chain, and star. Specifically, for ring networks, we study the effects of increasing nonlocality from local to global coupling on the overall dynamics of the system. Our findings reveal the existence of various synchronized states, including splay and cluster states, a partially synchronized state such as chimeric quasiperiodicity, and an oscillation quenching state such as amplitude death in these networks. Moreover, through an analysis of long-lived transients, we discover novel amplitude-modulated states within ring networks. Interestingly, we observe that increasing nonlocality diminishes the influence of the number of oscillators on the overall behavior in these networks. Furthermore, we note that chain networks, unlike ring networks, do not exhibit perfect synchrony among the coupled oscillators. In contrast, star networks demonstrate greater stability and are unaffected by the number of oscillators within the network. The insights from this study deepen our understanding of the dynamics of minimal networks and have implications for various fields, ranging from biology to engineering.}},

The avalanches coexist with the fully synchronous state where the units perform relaxation oscillations. We show that the mechanism behind the avalanches is based on an inhibitory effect of interactions, which may quench the spiking of units due to an interplay with the maximal canard. The avalanche activity bears certain heralds of criticality, including scale-invariant distributions of event sizes. Furthermore, the system shows increased sensitivity to perturbations, manifested as critical slowing down and reduced resilience.}},

Spatially neighboring plankton communities with different physical conditions can impact each other due to diffusive coupling. We show that local variations in the physical conditions can influence the global system in form of propagating pulses of high population densities.

By introducing a simple feedback factor in the diffusive coupling, we show that the stable (in)homogeneous steady states can be effectively destabilized to restore dynamic behaviours of coupled systems. Even a feeble deviation from the normal diffusive coupling drastically shrinks the death regions in the parameter space. The generality of our method is corroborated in diverse non-linear systems of diffusively coupled paradigmatic models with various death scenarios. Our study provides a general framework to strengthen the robustness of dynamic activity in diffusively coupled dynamical networks.

In this regard, the master stability function and time-averaged synchronization error are employed as the analytical and numerical approaches to examine complete synchronization. Apart from the complete synchrony, the constructed networks are explored to find other synchronization patterns and multistability. The results obtained from the master stability function analysis, which are further approved by the numerical outcomes, show that when coupled through the linear diffusive function, the interacting laser models achieve complete synchrony in a small value of the coupling parameter.

abstract = {{Partial phase synchronization, also reported as neuron cooperation, is a pivotal behavior of the brain and related to its main features, such as memory. The excess or even the lack of phase synchronization are associated with brain disorders like epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. These diseases may be related to malfunctioning of the synchronization process of the neurons, triggered by changes of the local dynamics of the neurons influenced by parameters such as the ion-channel conductance. In fact, it is common to change the local neuron dynamics, using drugs to block or activate specific channels, changing the conductance and bringing the synchronization process to some desired behavior. Here we show that there are two distinct mechanisms leading to network phase synchronized states. The first one is strongly affected by the individual neuron dynamics. In this case, the synchronous state of the network may occur for low values of the coupling, regardless of the network topology. The second synchronized state is induced by the network coupling, in this case the network coupling strength promotes synchronized global states, we say it is a network driver synchronization. We report here how individual characteristics of the local dynamics of the neurons, such as their linear stability, when coupled in a network may be a fundamental player in the phase synchronization process as a function of the coupling strength. Global and small-world topologies are considered for a Hindmarsh–Rose-neuron network. For both coupling schemes, the effects of the local dynamics are clear, inducing early or retarding the occurrence of partial phase synchronization of the network when the coupling strength is varied. In this scenario, we discuss the effect of the local dynamics of the neuron, showing it may be of fundamental importance to understand and control the process of the network phase synchronization. The study also brings useful information to the general understanding of network-phase-synchronization processes.}},

We focus on local, nonlinear excitations and diverse neural responses in an excitable one- and two-dimensional configuration of diffusively coupled FitzHugh–Rinzel neurons. The study of the emerging spatiotemporal patterns is essential in understanding the working mechanism in different brain areas. We derive analytically the coefficients of the amplitude equations in the vicinity of Hopf bifurcations and characterize various patterns, including spirals exhibiting complex geometric substructures. Furthermore, we derive analytically the condition for the development of antispirals in the neighborhood of the bifurcation point. The emergence of broken target waves can be observed to form spiral-like profiles. The spatial dynamics of the excitable system exhibits two- and multi-arm spirals for small diffusive couplings. Our results reveal a multitude of neural excitabilities and possible conditions for the emergence of spiral-wave formation. Finally, we show that the coupled excitable systems with different firing characteristics participate in a collective behavior that may contribute significantly to irregular neural dynamics.}},

One of these, in which the oscillators are synchronized, persists and is stable for all coupling strengths. The other, in which the oscillators are π radiant out of phase, disappears either in a Hopf bifurcation or when fixed points appear on the orbit at a critical ratio of the coupling strength to the frequency. The out-of-phase oscillation is unstable except on an open set in the frequency-coupling-strength plane which contains moderate values of both parameters. Furthermore, there are tori bifurcating from the out-of-phase solution, which means, according to the Arnol'd theory for Hopf bifurcations in maps, that there may be periodic solutions of arbitrarily large period and chaotic solutions as well. Numerous other bifurcations occur, and there are a number of higher codimension singularities.

The basic concepts and characteristics of coupling functions are presented through demonstrative examples of different domains, revealing the mechanisms and emphasizing their multivariate nature. The theory of coupling functions is discussed through gradually increasing complexity from strong and weak interactions to globally coupled systems and networks. A variety of methods that have been developed for the detection and reconstruction of coupling functions from measured data is described. These methods are based on different statistical techniques for dynamical inference. Stemming from physics, such methods are being applied in diverse areas of science and technology, including chemistry, biology, physiology, neuroscience, social sciences, mechanics, and secure communications.

In the present work, we identified an algorithmic neural substrate for modular computation through the study of multitasking artificial recurrent neural networks. Dynamical systems analyses revealed learned computational strategies mirroring the modular subtask structure of the training task set. Dynamical motifs, which are recurring patterns of neural activity that implement specific computations through dynamics, such as attractors, decision boundaries and rotations, were reused across tasks. For example, tasks requiring memory of a continuous circular variable repurposed the same ring attractor. We showed that dynamical motifs were implemented by clusters of units when the unit activation function was restricted to be positive. Cluster lesions caused modular performance deficits. Motifs were reconfigured for fast transfer learning after an initial phase of learning. This work establishes dynamical motifs as a fundamental unit of compositional computation, intermediate between neuron and network. As whole-brain studies simultaneously record activity from multiple specialized systems, the dynamical motif framework will guide questions about specialization and generalization. The authors identify reusable ‘dynamical motifs’ in artificial neural networks. These motifs enable flexible recombination of previously learned capabilities, promoting modular, compositional computation and rapid transfer learning. This discovery sheds light on the fundamental building blocks of intelligent behavior.}},

Gap junction coupling not only synchronizes the heterogeneous β-cell population, but can also modify the electrical behavior of the cells. These phenomena have been widely studied with mathematical models based on data from mouse β-cells. However, it is now known that human β-cell electrophysiology shows important differences to its rodent counterpart, and although human pancreatic islets express connexin-36 and show evidence of β-cell coupling, these aspects have been little investigated in human β-cells. Here we investigate theoretically, the gap junction coupling strength required for synchronizing electrical activity in a small cluster of cells simulated with a recent mathematical model of human β-cell electrophysiology. We find a lower limit for the coupling strength of approximately 20 pS (i.e., normalized to cell size, \textbackslashtextasciitilde2 pS pF−1) below which spiking electrical activity is asynchronous. To confront this theoretical lower bound with data, we use our model to estimate from an experimental patch clamp recording that the coupling strength is approximately 100–200 pS (10–20 pS pF−1), similar to previous estimates in mouse β-cells. We then investigate the role of gap junction coupling in synchronizing and modifying other forms of electrical activity in human β-cell clusters. We find that electrical coupling can prolong the period of rapid bursting electrical activity, and synchronize metabolically driven slow bursting, in particular when the metabolic oscillators are in phase. Our results show that realistic coupling conductances are sufficient to promote synchrony in small clusters of human β-cells as observed experimentally, and provide motivation for further detailed studies of electrical coupling in human pancreatic islets.}},

The appearance of gap junctional coupling in the nervous system is developmentally regulated, restricted to distinct cell types and persists after the establishment of chemical synapses, thus suggesting that this form of cell–cell signaling may be functionally interrelated with, rather than alternative to chemical transmission.

Despite profound insights into the motor patterns1, biomechanics2,3 and aerodynamics underlying asynchronous flight4,5, the architecture and function of the central-pattern-generating (CPG) neural network remain unclear. Here, on the basis of an experiment–theory approach including electrophysiology, optophysiology, Drosophila genetics and mathematical modelling, we identify a miniaturized circuit solution with unexpected properties. The CPG network consists of motoneurons interconnected by electrical synapses that, in contrast to doctrine, produce network activity splayed out in time instead of synchronized across neurons. Experimental and mathematical evidence support a generic mechanism for network desynchronization that relies on weak electrical synapses and specific excitability dynamics of the coupled neurons. In small networks, electrical synapses can synchronize or desynchronize network activity, depending on the neuron-intrinsic dynamics and ion channel composition. In the asynchronous flight CPG, this mechanism translates unpatterned premotor input into stereotyped neuronal firing with fixed sequences of cell activation that ensure stable wingbeat power and, as we show, is conserved across multiple species. Our findings prove a wider functional versatility of electrical synapses in the dynamic control of neural circuits and highlight the relevance of detecting electrical synapses in connectomics. In the Drosophila central-pattern-generating neural network, a mechanism for network desynchronization relying on weak electrical synapses and specific excitability dynamics of the coupled neurons translates unpatterned premotor input into stereotyped neuronal firing with fixed sequences of cell activation, ensuring stable wingbeat power.}},

abstract = {{Neurons with oscillatory properties are a common feature of the nervous system, but little is known about how neural oscillators shape the behavior of neuronal networks or how network interactions influence the properties of neural oscillators. Mathematical models are used to examine the effect of electrically coupling an oscillatory neuron to a second neuron that is either silent or tonically firing. Models of oscillatory neurons with varying degrees of complexity show that this coupling can either increase or decrease the frequency of an oscillator, depending on its membrane potential wave form, the state of the neuron to which it is coupled, and the strength of the coupling. Thus, electrical coupling provides a flexible mechanism for modifying the behavior of an oscillatory neural network.}},

Here, we present a model of two competing species in a two-patch habitat with migrations between patches. We derive equilibrium solutions of this model for three cases of migration rate resulting in isolated, well-mixed and semi-isolated habitats. We evaluate the full range of effects of habitat, life-history and migration parameters on population sizes. Finally, we add harvesting mortality and define conditions under which introduction of a no-harvesting (protected) area may lead to increased maximum sustainable yield. The results have applications in mixed fishery management and the design of wildlife protection zones, including marine protected areas (MPAs).}},

It is still challenging to develop an ecological network construction method based on landscape connectivity for multiple species. The purpose of this study is to propose a multi-species framework approach for constructing ecological networks and determine the restoration priority for four focal mammal species across the protected areas in the western mountains of Henan Province, China. We built ecological networks for each species by using circuit theory and least-cost path models, and integrated the ecological corridors and key barrier areas to determine the restoration priority for multiple species. The results showed that the connectivity of the ecological network was closely related to the species dispersal capacity. For species with higher dispersal capacity, all core areas were interconnected and have multiple alternative paths, and the network of protected areas seemed to be well connected. With the decline of species dispersal ability, ecological networks became more complex and not well connected, and more migration corridors that exceed species dispersal capability have emerged. It was important to consider the needs for species-specific management plans. Key ecological corridors and barrier areas, which have significant impacts on species migration, are mainly land use areas dominated by cropland. Our research indicates that the methods proposed in this study can help determine the restoration priority of key ecological corridors and barrier areas, which may facilitate conservation efforts for multiple species, especially in areas with poor species distribution and movement data.}},

In the proposed spatial model, each local patch sustains a three-level trophic system composed of interacting predators, consumers and vegetation. Populations oscillate regularly and periodically in phase, but with irregular and chaotic peaks together in abundance—twin realistic features that are not found in standard ecological models. In a spatial lattice of patches, only small amounts of local migration are required to induce broad-scale ‘phase synchronization’12,13, with all populations in the lattice phase-locking to the same collective rhythm. Peak population abundances, however, remain chaotic and largely uncorrelated. Although synchronization is often perceived as being detrimental to spatially structured populations14, phase synchronization leads to the emergence of complex chaotic travelling-wave structures which may be crucial for species persistence.}},

For instance, many synchronization patterns result from the underlying network symmetries, and high symmetries are known to increase the stability of synchronization. Yet here we find that general macroscopic features of network solutions such as regularity can be induced by breaking their symmetry of interactions. We demonstrate this effect in an ecological multilayer network where the topological asymmetries occur naturally. These asymmetries rescue the system from chaotic oscillations by establishing stable periodic orbits and equilibria. We call this phenomenon asymmetry-induced order and uncover its mechanism by analyzing both analytically and numerically the absence of dynamics on the system's synchronization manifold. Moreover, the bifurcation scenario describing the route from chaos to order is also disclosed. We demonstrate that this result also holds for generic node dynamics by analyzing coupled paradigmatic Rössler and Lorenz systems.}},

The framework provides a set of concepts and tools that can be adapted and applied to ecology, facilitating research on high-dimensional, heterogeneous systems in nature. Here, we formally define ecological multilayer networks based on a review of previous, related approaches; illustrate their application and potential with analyses of existing data; and discuss limitations, challenges, and future applications. The integration of multilayer network theory into ecology offers largely untapped potential to investigate ecological complexity and provide new theoretical and empirical insights into the architecture and dynamics of ecological systems. Ecological interactions typically vary across both space and time.

We find two distinct transient chimera states distinguished by their abrupt or gradual termination. We analyze the lifetime of both chimera states, unraveling their dependence on coupling range and size. We find an optimal value for the coupling range yielding the longest lifetime for the chimera states.

Healthy and stable soil is a prerequisite for well-functioning terrestrial ecosystems and has, thus, been proposed to play a key role in plant diversity–ecosystem functioning relationships. The overall objective of this sub-project is to study multidimensional soil stability as affected by plant diversity in a long-term plant diversity experiment. We designed three coordinated work packages (WPs) to comprehensively assess soil multistability to environmental fluctuations and climate extremes by considering the biological, chemical and physical dimensions that are key for soil functioning. We will use all unique facilities and approaches of the Jena Experiment Research Unit by combining synthesis of long-term data in the Main Experiment and the ΔBEF Experiment with performing new soil analyses in the DrY Experiment, the ResCUE Experiment and a joint CoMic Experiment, to gain a better mechanistic understanding of plant diversity–ecosystem functioning relationships. In close collaboration with other sub-projects, we will assess biological, chemical and physical soil properties and stability indicators that will be used to calculate soil multifunctionality and multistability indices. In WP1, we will build on three unique datasets to explore short-term and long-term effects of plant diversity on the stability of soil (microbial) properties. In WP2, we will combine different datasets and approaches to explore if plant diversity effects on the magnitude and stability of soil properties increase with abiotic and biotic stresses. In WP3, we will combine measurements of the above-mentioned dimensions of soil stability to explore if plant diversity increases the stability of multiple soil properties under hot drought. This sub-project is at the heart of the Research Unit by testing the overarching hypotheses outlined in the Coordination Proposal of the Jena Experiment, contributing to all main experiments, sharing data and performing joint sampling campaigns with all sub-projects and, at the same time, introducing a novel concept of soil multistability as affected by plant diversity and climate extremes. We propose to use a combination of simple, high-throughput (e.g. bait-lamina test) and more sophisticated methods (e.g. extracellular polymeric substances analyses) to be able to investigate temporal dynamics of soil processes and their mechanistic basis. Taken together, the results of the three WPs will provide new insights into the stabilising mechanisms of soil properties in the long term and in relation to climate extremes through plant diversity.}},

abstract = {{Compositional multistability is widely observed in multispecies ecological communities. Since differences in community composition often lead to differences in community function, understanding compositional multistability is essential to comprehend the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystems. In community assembly studies, it has long been recognized that the order and timing of species migration and extinction influence structure and function of communities. The study of multistability in ecology has focused on the change in dynamical stability across environmental gradients, and was developed mainly for low‐dimensional systems. As a result, methodologies for studying the compositional stability of empirical multispecies communities are not well developed. Here, we show that models previously used in ecology can be analyzed from a new perspective, the energy landscape, to unveil compositional stability in observational data. To show that our method can be applicable to real‐world ecological communities, we simulated assembly dynamics driven by population‐level processes, and show that results were mostly robust to different simulation assumptions. Our method reliably captured the change in the overall compositional stability of multispecies communities over environmental change, and indicated a small fraction of community compositions that may be channels for transitions between stable states. When applied to murine gut microbiota, our method showed the presence of two alternative states whose relationship changes with age, and suggested mechanisms by which aging affects the compositional stability of the murine gut microbiota. Our method provides a practical tool to study the compositional stability of communities in a changing world, and will facilitate empirical studies that integrate the concept of multistability from different fields.}},

Climate changes leading to the species decay parameter drifts can drive various ecological systems towards a tipping point. We investigate the tipping-point dynamics in multi-layer ecological networks supported by mutualism. We unveil a natural mechanism by which the occurrence of tipping points can be delayed by multiplexity that broadly describes the diversity of the species abundances, the complexity of the interspecific relationships, and the topology of linkages in ecological networks. For a double-layer system of pollinators and plants, coupling between the network layers occurs when there is dispersal of pollinator species. Multiplexity emerges as the dispersing species establish their presence in the destination layer and have a simultaneous presence in both. We demonstrate that the new mutualistic links induced by the dispersing species with the residence species have fundamental benefits to the well-being of the ecosystem in delaying the tipping point and facilitating species recovery. Articulating and implementing control mechanisms to induce multiplexity can thus help sustain certain types of ecosystems that are in danger of extinction as the result of environmental changes.}},

We present system parameter regions for the existence of solitary states in the case of local, non-local, and global network couplings and show that they preserve in both thermodynamic and conservative limits.
