# optional to-do
## methodology
1. Kuramoto: twisted states, basin size & eigenvalues in Mihara 2022

for later

1. malleability: multistability results; check for sure the dynamics in the diff topologies - any chaos ever? for random tops? why does all-to-all have this chaotic, non phase locked, behavior??
2. review linearization
3. review homeomorphisms
4. review kuramoto derivation: why alpha and beta -> infity??
