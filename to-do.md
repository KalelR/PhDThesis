1. methodology: bifurcations - homoc tangential??
2. intro: discuss the drosophyla paper?; maybe go back and write more about metastability? introduce ghost from kelso? 
7. malleability: multistability results; check for sure the dynamics in the diff topologies - any chaos ever? for random tops? why does all-to-all have this chaotic, non phase locked, behavior??
8. list of publications: explain briefly the smaller publications

# optional to-do
## methodology
1. Kuramoto: twisted states, basin size & eigenvalues in Mihara 2022
